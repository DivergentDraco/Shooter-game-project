# Shooter-game-project
 Wongnai RISE UP

Welcome, anyone who has passed through here. I am DivergentDraco, also known as Divergo. If I am correct, this Git should be private, but idk.

We started this project only with only two people, Nitirushh, and me. It was just a jumpstart project to learn new things and find a way to finish projects once and for all. However, I suffer from headache and stress just from learning to code alone, and so I have to postpone this for 4 months.

Now, with this discovery about the existence of Github. To any programmer who wants to learn about Godot, or have significant experience, or just want to wreck havoc this disastrous code, I welcome you.

This game will be run by Godot, written in GDScript. It is a bullethell game that Nitirushh had an initial idea of, like a Touhou game but with some spices of Galaga.
