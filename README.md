# Shooter-game-project
 Wongnai RISE UP

Welcome, anyone who has passed through here. I am DivergentDraco, also known as Divergo. If I am correct, this Git should be private, but idk.

We started this project only with only two people, Nitirushh, and me. It was just a jumpstart project to learn new things and find a way to finish projects once and for all. However, I suffer from headache and stress just from learning to code alone, and so I have to postpone this for 4 months.

Now, with this discovery about the existence of Github. To any programmer who wants to learn about Godot, or have significant experience, or just want to wreck havoc this disastrous code, I welcome you.

This game will be run by Godot, written in GDScript. It is a bullethell game that Nitirushh had an initial idea of, like a Touhou game but with some spices of Galaga.

How to import:
- Open Godot and press "import"
- Go to the "Shooter game project godot file" folder, select an obvious file called "project.godot"
- Press "Import and edit" andddd should be good to go

Controls:\
Mouse click the start button to start\
Arrow keys to move\
Z to shoot (You can just hold the button to continuously shoot it)

TO DO LIST:
- Fix and change the start button from clicking the start text to pressing Z button (priority)
- Make more enemy scenes from the sprites and animations folder
- Coming up with a better way to create the stage
- Make a title screen / UI rework
- Effect rework (Probably going with Balatro style)
